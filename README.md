Test edit from Tom

Notes from Curtis:
- I was looking into storing the photos in the db, but it's pretty cumbersome because you have to 
  convert the image file to a binary array and then store it.  Retreiving is in reverse (get the 
  binary blob and convert it back to an image).  I didn't want to figure out the commands, so
  the best alternative is to store the filename.  Makes sense to me.

- I added a CHANGELOG file to document things as we've changed/added.

- I've been adding TODO notes to the code as I go so I don't forget about doing something later.
  Feel free to add some as you go as well.
