Random List of Todo's
=====================

 - CSS Style: class and id styling of Profile picture upload
 - Image file validation like previous entries?  Also value="" field 
 - Does the profile picture need a different filename choice?  Maybe based on the upload time.
 - Default image needs to be set if photo==null
    - database will automatically assign DefaultProfilePicture.jpg if the field is empty.
    - My guess is that the DB INSERT item should have newFileName==null  (not tested)
 - Captcha Setup
