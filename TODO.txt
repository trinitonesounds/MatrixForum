Random List of Todo's
=====================

Register Page
 - CSS Style: class and id styling of Profile picture upload
 - Image file validation
    - maximum size
    - only jpg or png
    - Error message when there's a problem
    - value="" field ??
 - Does the profile picture need a different filename choice?  Maybe based on the upload time.
 - Default image needs to be set if photo==null
    - database will automatically assign DefaultProfilePicture.jpg if the field is empty.
    - My guess is that the DB INSERT item should have newFileName==null  (not tested)
 - Captcha Setup
 - Check for duplicate username (I see code but not yet tested)
 
 Admin Page
    - Edit user from Admin Page Errors (It was copied from EditProduct)
        - What will it edit
            - Password?
            - Profile Picture?
            - Email address?
        - Restrict to authenticated Admin

      - Needs Profile Picture
      - CSS Layout
    - Needs Profile Picture
    - Needs Username
    - Remove UserID
    - MemberSince isn't in the assignment, but I think it's good info to have on the Admin page
Admin Page Charts
    - Decide which 3 to show...

Member Page
    - Display only the latest 5 Posts
        See page 92 in the text for "Paging through Data" -- might help
    - allows <script>alert("This is a test")</script> but .NET catches it as "suspicious".
    - CSS Style messageTextArea
    - CSS Style postMessage

-Include Email confirmation for registration (5 marks)

-Publish website so we can register for reCaptcha keys. An alternative could be to just add an "I am not a robot" checkbox. 

-Need "most followed" and "most active contributor" links.

-Create 2 seperate Admin pages for Manage Users (what we currently have) and Main Page (just to show the charts)
