 - CSS Style: class and id styling of Profile picture upload
 - Image file validation
    - maximum size
    - only jpg or png
    - Error message when there's a problem
    - value="" field ??
 - Does the profile picture need a different filename choice?  Maybe based on the upload time.
 - Default image needs to be set if photo==null
    - database will automatically assign DefaultProfilePicture.jpg if the field is empty.
    - My guess is that the DB INSERT item should have newFileName==null  (not tested)

-Include Email confirmation for registration (5 marks)

-Publish website so we can register for reCaptcha keys. An alternative could be to just add an "I am not a robot" checkbox. 

-Need "most followed" and "most active contributor" links.

-Create 2 seperate Admin pages for Manage Users (what we currently have) and Main Page (just to show the charts)
